___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Toshibha, Intel, Western digital(WDC/WD), sandisk, skhynix, Micron, Samsung --> Memory based products

1. end-user = amazon/flipkart
2. Customer(OEM- original Equipement Manufacturer): Lenovo, Dell, Hp, THinkpad, Acer
3. Data center = facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft, 

generic tests(applicable to customer)*customer specific tests

Team structure:

1. Firmware team: 50
Firmware: Any electronic device will work based on firmware/binary/firmware program
Eg: Washing machine, TV, AC
programming language: Embedded C, C
Storage protocols(specification pdf based on which they will develop) Eg: NVMe, PCIe, MI


2. Firmware Validation team :30
work: They will write test cases -5000 in embedded python/python to validate the firmware developed by Firmware team.
programming language: Embedded python, python
Storage protocols(specification pdf based on which they will develop) Eg: NVMe, PCIe, MI


3. Test execution/Framework Automation Team: 5
work: Need to develop an environment that can run/pick validation scripts based upon OEM(customer) and generate the results,logs,reports and raise the bugs.
Framework name: MSVP : Mutli System validation platform

os/platform: Windows, Azure, (linux)

windows vs Azure

conval = conval validation
a) Framework Automation/Test execution Automation
why?
Need to develop an environment
Skills:  Resume mentioned skills

conval : Need to Continuously validate a set of test cases applicable for given memory product based on generic/customer requirement and generate logs, inspect the logs and give a consolidated conval report.

Need fix our exisiting scripts in case of programming errors
Need to develope new scripts if new requirement comes

b) Manual Testing

Report the bug: If Test script fails, need to report to validation/FW team using jira dashboard
