# class = how a object should be/blueprint(class Person defines how a person should be)

# object = physical presence(Avinash should follow Person class)

Eg:1 class laptop
    object lenovo, dell, Thinkpad
    object properties/ attributes: display,CPU, Hard disk

Eg:2 class Person
    object Avinash, Ganesh, Bharath
    object properties/ attributes: legs,hands, eyes

Eg:3 class Building design
    object Tajmahal design, charminar design
    object properties/ atributes: paint, bricks, steel

class contains methods and variables normally but not mandatory
we can create multiple objects to a same class

object= instance= reference

 instance methods = non-class methods = non-static methods
 non-instance methods = class methods = static methods

 constructor = intializer = init method
