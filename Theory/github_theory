Github??

It is repository(where we will store code/files) to push/maintain/publish/review/pull code.

why??

We need share our development code with other team members, so we need to publish(push) our code.

How?

Please install github account and install git software in your machine .See SOP(standard operating procedure) document for more details.

cloning: downloading source code

Right click in any fresh folder and select "git bash here" and give below command.
git clone https://github.com/Raviteja474/Raviteja_teaching.git

after every class:
git pull origin main


branch: individually developed code
pull request/merge request : Requesting approval to merge our changes with master/main branch
approve: give yes to merge changes
rejection: says No and ask developer to re-work
merge: merging working branch/branch with main/master branch

push: pushing/committing  our changes to branch
pull: taking the code from branch
clone: first time downloading the code
