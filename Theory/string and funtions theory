default = usually expected value



Modulaity = we need to divide the program logically
atomosity = each function is atom, that function should carry single responsibility
reusability = reusage purpose, we will call function multiple times from mutiple places
maintainability = documentation (purpose, inputs, outputs), need to change function in future in case of requirement change

explicit = forcefully or manually
